# Movie App

## Overview

A React-based web application that leverages the OMDb API to retrieve movie information. The app has numerous features, including searching for movies, viewing in-depth details about selected films, and adding or removing movies from a watchlist. To ensure the app's state is always accessible, I incorporated local storage.
